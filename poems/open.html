      <p>i don't think this is poetry</p>
      <p>i think this is just a desperate plea for home</p>
      <p>for time to wind back toward the place where</p>
      <p>in another universe</p>
      <p>i am supposed to be</p>
      <br>
      <p>i don't know how to make it pretty</p>
      <p>or big enough</p>
      <p>or small enough</p>
      <p>i don't know how to transcribe</p>
      <p>what my bones are begging for</p>
      <p>into words that are my language</p>
      <p>that became our language</p>
