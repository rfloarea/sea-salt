  <div class="poem">
    <p>there is a well inside of me</p>
    <p>it rises</p>
    <p>to meet the tide</p>
    <br>
    <p>i want to bury</p>
    <p>myself in soil</p>
    <p>that knows me</p>
    <br>
    <p>i want to bury</p>
    <p>us in soil</p>
    <p>that knows us</p>
    <br>
    <p>there is a well inside of me</p>
    <p>it stretches</p>
    <p>to meet the tide</p>
    <br>
    <p>i want to go home</p>
    <p>sink into soil</p>
    <p>sink into salt</p>
    <p>let the tide pull me</p>
    <p>out and in</p>
    <p>in and out</p>
    <p>let the earth sink me</p>
    <p>into her</p>
    <br>
    <p>i want to know the spirits</p>
    <p>i want them to know me</p>
    <p>i want to go home to soil</p>
    <br>
    <p>the sea remembers me</p>
