  <h1>bone</h1>
  <div class="poem">
    <p>what i find are scattered shreds</p>
    <p>tracing up and down a stretch of land</p>
    <p>they did not know</p>
    <p>a path worn to bone</p>
    <br>
    <p>what i find are pieces clawing for home</p>
    <p>pins tacked into each joint</p>
    <p>slipping them in and out</p>
    <p>out and in</p>
    <br>
    <p>we could have known this land</p>
    <p>we could have known our land</p>
    <p>instead you wrenched us from it all</p>
    <br>
    <p>a friend reminded me today</p>
    <p>it doesn't matter whether you believe in land spirits</p>
    <p>they know us</p>
    <p>interact</p>
    <p>with us</p>
    <p>we could have known them</p>
    <p>too</p>
    <p>in my bones, we do</p>
